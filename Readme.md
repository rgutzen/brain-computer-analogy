# Benefits and problems of the brain-computer analogy. Do we limit our understanding by thinking in terms of neural ‘coding’, ‘computation’, and ‘processing’?

*Its our hubris as humans that convinces us the nature of the universe is expressible in the language that we have at our disposal right now. [..] our theories are strongly latched to our description languages, even our basic observations can not be independent of our theories. When our language changes, our observations changes.* - Sam Gershman

## Organization of the session
#### Short presentations (max. 6 topics, max. 10min)
Since there are more topics than time slots, please enter your initials to the topics you are interested in. [To vote, edit the wiki page of this repo](https://github.com/rgutzen/brain-computer-analogy/wiki).

Add an '!' if you would be willing to prepare the short presentation. You can add a '!' to multiple topics, but no-one will present more than one. Forming pairs is fine. I will talk to you afterwards to distribute the topic preparation according to the preferences.
**Please vote until this Friday!**.

Also please feel free to add and specify topics as you see fit, and add resources to the list which could help others.

* **Scope of the brain-computer analogy**:
which terms and comparisons do we use, what do they mean/imply? *(e.g. algorithm, processing, en/de-coding, memory, hardware, software, ..)*

* **Useful computer analogies**:
examples of where they improve our understanding

* **Misleading computer analogies**:
examples where they are false, or we don't know yet *(e.g. case of cognition via logic operators)*

* **Computer analogy as simplifications**:
what features do we discard?

* **The neural 'code'!?**:
different uses of 'neural code' in literature?

* **The other way around**:
neuroscience analogies influencing computing *(e.g. Turing & von-Neuman, neuromorphic hardware, ML, embodied computing)*

* **Alternative analogies**:
examples and how are they are better/worse/different? *(e.g. steam-machine, hydraulics, ant colonies, orchestra)*

* **Historic examples**:
analogies in other fields and what effect did they have?

* **Alternative brain analogies**:
in what cases are they useful?

* **Is this important?**:
the case for/against spending time thinking about analogy use

#### Discussion (min. 20min) with take-away goals:
* Listing all the analogies
* In what cases do the analogies fail?
* In what cases are the analogies useful?
* In the useful cases, to what degree do they apply and what to keep in mind when using them
