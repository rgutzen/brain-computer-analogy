# Benefits and problems of the brain-computer analogy. Do we limit our understanding by thinking in terms of neural ‘coding’, ‘computation’, and ‘processing’?

*Its our hubris as humans that convinces us the nature of the universe is expressible in the language that we have at our disposal right now. [..] our theories are strongly latched to our description languages, even our basic observations can not be independent of our theories. When our language changes, our observations changes.* - Sam Gershman

## Specific questions
* Which analogies do we use, and what do they imply?
* In what sense does the brain work like a computer?
* How does the brain not work like a computer?
* In what cases don't we know whether the brain-computer analogy is justified?
* What are alternative analogies, how are they better/worse/different?
